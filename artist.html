              <h2>I'm Bhavna Paikattil.</h2> 
              <p>This is my creative outlet shaped by my hobby. Similar to most people in the pandemic, I started a few new hobbies. One of these was resin. In the beginning, I made small pieces for my friends and family. They were not the best, but were made out of love. Soon, I did get better and started making things which people actually asked about. This gave me an idea. Why not start selling my products? And that's how Paika Design was born. Here I am showcasing a few of my best sellers which I made.</p>
